## axNote : a simple note taking app in ReactJS

This is my version of a simple react note taking app. I mainly wanted to train my React skills and test out new functionalities.<br /><br />
A few thing that you can do with this app :
<ul>
<li>Add and/or edit notes, each with a title, a content and optional tags.</li>
<li>Delete a note</li>
<li>Filter the notes panel by search</li>
<li>Filter the notes panel by tags</li>
<li>Add new tags</li>
<li>Be warned if you didn't save your note</li>
</ul><br /><br />
Anyway, you can try it by yourself !
